MIPS Simulator
Computer Architecture Project 1
By: David Ferlemann

Description:
This program currently only targeting to satisfy course project 1 requirements - a unpipelined MIPS simulation that takes in a file containing machine code for a program. 

Things not working yet (Future improvements):
- It doesn't support pipelined operations
- No Exception handling for instructions. Signed and unsigned instructions are treated the same.
